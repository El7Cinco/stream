	<p>PeerTube is a federated video hosting network. And this channel
	allows you to browse /Music and other categories. It's not a very
	broad video ecosystem yet, but fairly international. So perhaps worth a
	lookaround.</p>

        <p>The category list seems to be uniform across most Peertube
	instances. So you only need to reload stations/videos once switching
	the address in the settings. </p>

        <p>Per default you should use VLC and 
        <link href="http://youtube-dl.org/">youtube-dl</link> in the
	playback settings. Per default the faux mime type <cmd>video/youtube</cmd>
	is used for all listings. However, internally there's a lookup for
	a .m3u or direct .mp4 link already. So the <cmd>video/*</cmd> entry should
	also be populated.</p>

            <p>Sets the main instance to query video listings from. Now most
	    of the other sites will be peered, so the main server doesn't
	    have that much influence. It changes the ordering however, and
            will reveal more local videos or languages usually.</p>

            <p>Future plugin versions might offer a language filter option.
            Currently there's not enough content to warrant it.</p>
